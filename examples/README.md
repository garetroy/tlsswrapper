## Examples
These examples are to show some basic usage cases for this library. All examples are explained in the code at the top of what they are trying to display or achieve. To run these examples you can do the following..

    cp [EXAMPLE YOU WANT] ../src/tlswrapper.cxx
    cd ../build
    ./build.sh

After that, the examples should be built. To run these examples all you have to do is run the following command. There are two commands to specify if you want to run the server part of the example or the client part of the example. (1 for server, 0 for client)

    ./tlswrapper [OPTION]
